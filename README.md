- Design
	- Colour Scheme	
		- The main colours used are blue, orange and pink. These colours were chosen as they tie-in with the pre-existing logo and therefore helps to reinforce the brand.

	- Typography
		- The Roboto Slap font matches with the pre-exisiting logo and therefore helps reinforce the brand. Sans-serif is used as a backup font in case for some reason the font doesn't get imported into the website properly.

	- Imagery
		- The landing page image is an amended version of the business logo. It is bright and colourful and will catch the user's attention. It also helps to reinforce the brand.
