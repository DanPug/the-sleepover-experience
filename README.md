# The Sleepover Experience

The Sleepover Experience is a site for my business that will help to promote what we do.
The site will be targeted toward potential customers who are looking to hire sleepover tents for children in the Neath Port Talbot area.
The Sleepover Experience will be useful for potential customers to see what themes we have available, the prices and to make a booking.
