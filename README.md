The Sleepover Experience is a site for my business that will help to promote what we do.
The site will be targeted toward potential customers who are looking to hire sleepover tents for children in the Neath Port Talbot area.
The Sleepover Experience will be useful for potential customers to see what themes we have available, the prices and to make a booking.

- Design
	- Colour Scheme	
		- The main colours used are blue, orange and pink. These colours were chosen as they tie-in with the pre-existing logo and therefore helps to reinforce the brand.

	- Typography
		- The Roboto Slap font matches with the pre-exisiting logo and therefore helps reinforce the brand. Sans-serif is used as a backup font in case for some reason the font doesn't get imported into the website properly.

	- Imagery
		- The landing page image is an amended version of the business logo. It is bright and colourful and will catch the user's attention. It also helps to reinforce the brand.
